The time complexity of radix sort can be analyzed in terms of the distribution and combination phases.

During the distribution phase, radix sort distributes the input elements into buckets based on their digits, one digit at a time. The time complexity of this phase is O(n), where n is the number of input elements, because each element is inspected once and placed into the appropriate bucket.

During the combination phase, radix sort combines the buckets in the order of their significance to produce the final sorted output. The time complexity of this phase is O(d * (n + k)), where d is the number of digits in the maximum element, n is the number of input elements, and k is the number of possible digit values. This is because each element is examined d times to determine its digit value, and the elements are then combined by iterating over each bucket and appending the elements to the output array.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of radix sort is O(d * (n + k)), where d is typically a small constant relative to n and k. This makes radix sort an efficient algorithm for sorting large integers or other types of data that can be represented as a sequence of digits. However, for small input sizes or when the number of digits is large, the overhead of the bucket data structures may outweigh the benefits of radix sort.

Distribution: O(n)
Combine (1 pass): O(n + k)
Combine (total): O(d * (n + k))

if k is subjected to O(n) and simultanously n is subjected to O(n + k), then radix sort's complexity is under O(n), linear time.

The space complexity of radix sort can be analyzed in terms of the number of additional memory units (e.g. bytes) required by the algorithm. The space complexity of radix sort is O(n + k), where n is the number of input elements and k is the number of possible digit values.
